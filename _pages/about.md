Welcome! I am Zheheng, a second-year PhD student doing Natural Language Processing at the University of Manchester. Fortunate to be supervised by [Prof.Sophia Ananiadou](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/sophia.ananiadou.html) and [Prof.Jun'ichi Tsujii](http://www.nactem.ac.uk/profile.php?member=jtsujii), I am currently working on text summarization and topic modelling. My long-term goal would be to participate in building machines that can naturally interact with humans.

I am seeking internships for applied NLP research, drop me an email if you're interested!
